           <h2 >10. Dealing with shoplifters</h2>
           <p id="list">The awkward moment when a customer expects you to do something, but corporate wants you to do nothing.  
                The worst part is that the shoplifters know this and keep coming.</p>

           <h2>9. Customer returns</h2>
           <p id="list">The other kind of thief.  Most of the time it's a stolen item and/or stolen receipt they dug out of the trash can clear across the other side of town.
                Either way, when it's refused, all <b>hell</b> breaks loose and it becomes a debate on our return policy.</p>

           <h2>8. Customers making a mess</h2>
           <p id="list">It amazes me how messy people can be, and how quick they can make a mess.  
               Nothings more frustrating then when you fold a table of t-shirts 30 minutes before closing and one customer completly detroys it in under 10 minutes.</p>

           <h2>7. Customers showing up minutes before we close</h2>
           <p id="list">Nothing brings me more joy then seeing that the store is closing in 5 minutes.  
               Then a customer walks in, and I go from happy to annoyed in seconds.  I now know what it's like to be bipolar.</p>

           <h2>6. The Customer is <b>NOT</b> always right</h2>
           <p id="list">Customers always think they know best.  99.9% of the time they have no clue.<br>
            Customer: "I need help finding this item."<br>
            Me: "I've never seen that item before."<br>
            Customer: "Well I always buy this item here."<br>
            Me: "Sorry but it must be some other store."<br>
            Customer: "No it's here"<br>
            Me: "I've never seen that in this store as long as I've been here."<br>
            Customer: "How long have you worked here?"<br>
            Me: "13 years"</p>

               <h2>5. And the dumbest question award goes to...</h2>
               <p id="list">Customer: "Do you work here?"<br>
                Me: "No I just wear this uniform and name badge for the fun of it."<br>
                Customer: "What is the price of this item?"<br>
                Me: "Well the tag under it says $9.99."<br>
                Customer: "Where can I find Advil?"<br>
                Me: "It's right in front of you."</p>

               <h2>4. Rude customers</h2>
               <p id="list">Apparently I don't just work here, but I also, write the policies, set the prices, 
                   and can manipulate the federal law in the customers favor.  Who knew?!</p>

               <h2>3. Holiday shoppers</h2>
               <p id="list">Please wait until the last minute to do all your shopping.  I don't need to see my family.</p>

               <h2>2. Patience is a virtue</h2>
               <p id="list">Having to fake laugh or smile at customers is a work of art that takes years to master.  If I hear
                   "If it were a snake it'd bite me" or "If it didn't scan, it must be free" one more time I might have to punch someone.
